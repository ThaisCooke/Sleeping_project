/*Clean the data:
1. I considered any percentage of sleep disruption that was above 0.05 as a night classified as "Difficult Staying Asleep".
I Started by fixing the "Difficult staying asleep", which should be "1" if the percentage of lost sleep is more than 5%.
To find those dates, I did the following:*/



--To fix "Difficult staying asleep", and replace "0" by "1", first I had to check which dates needed to be altered:


 SELECT CAST ([Date] AS Date) AS [Date],
  [Difficult Staying asleep],
  Sleep_disruption_percentage
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE Sleep_disruption_percentage > 0.05
  AND [Difficult Staying asleep] = 0

  --Which gave me those results:

  [Date]			Difficult Staying asleep		Sleep_disruption_percentage
2023-02-06					0							0.08
2023-04-10					0							0.055
2023-05-21					0							0.13
2023-05-24					0							0.063


--Those records needed to be updated. The UPDATE statement was used:

UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET [Difficult Staying asleep]  = '1'
  WHERE [Date] = '2023-02-06' 

  UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET [Difficult Staying asleep]  = '1'
  WHERE [Date] = '2023-04-10'

  UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET [Difficult Staying asleep]  = '1'
  WHERE [Date] = '2023-05-21'

  UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET [Difficult Staying asleep]  = '1'
  WHERE [Date] = '2023-05-24'

  --When checking the query, the results had been updated:

  SELECT CAST ([Date] AS Date) AS [Date],
  [Difficult Staying asleep],
  Sleep_disruption_percentage
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE Sleep_disruption_percentage > 0.05
  AND [Difficult Staying asleep] = 0

  [Date]			Difficult Staying asleep		Sleep_disruption_percentage


  --There was a typo on the table. The table said "Completed Rested" instead of "Completely Rested".
  --To fix that, the UPDATE statement was used:

  UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET Restdness_when_waking_up  = 'Completely Rested'
  WHERE Restdness_when_waking_up = 'Completed Rested'


/*2. Decide what to do with NULLS*/

--*I decided to delete those rows instead of trying to populate it, since there was no data recorded for all the fields.
--The DELETE statement was used

DELETE FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE [Workout early the day before] IS NULL

--There was one "NULL" on day 05-13-2023. That was replaced by the data for that day:

UPDATE [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  SET Three_day_Sleep_Target  = 'On Target'
  WHERE [Date] = '2023-05-13'
