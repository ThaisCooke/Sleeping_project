/*Questions to be answered, now with the data cleaned:

1. What is the average sleep (in hours) that I had during this period of time?
2. How does the average sleep (in hours) compares to the fatigue during the day?
3. How does sleep disruption percentage relates to fatigueness during the day?
4. What is the main sleep disruption factor that has been recorded in this period of time? 
5. What is the main factor (in percentage) that made me lose sleep and impacted the restdness when waking up the most 
  (or the fatigueness during the day)?
6. Create a SP to play with parameters and answer: How does three day sleep target relates to fatigueness during the day?
7. Does working out helps for better night sleep?*/



-- 1. What is the average sleep (in hours) that I had during this period of time?

SELECT AVG (total_sleep_time_minutes) / 60 AS Avg_sleep_per_night_in_hours
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]

  --Avg_sleep_per_night_in_hours: 7.78
  


   --2. How does the average sleep (in hours) compares to the fatigue during the day?

   SELECT 
  AVG (total_sleep_time_minutes) / 60 AS Avg_sleep_per_night_in_hours
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE
  Fatigueness_during_the_day = 'Not at all Fatigued'


  SELECT 
  AVG (total_sleep_time_minutes) / 60 AS Avg_sleep_per_night_in_hours
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE
  Fatigueness_during_the_day = 'Completely Fatigued'


  /*On the days where there was no fatigueness during the day, the average sleep was 8.47 hr, vs 7.26 hr 
  on the days where there was a lot of fatigueness during the day*/


  --3. How does sleep disruption percentage relates to fatigueness during the day?


 SELECT 
  AVG(Sleep_Disruption_percentage * 100) AS Sleep_disruption_percentage
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE
  Fatigueness_during_the_day = 'Completely Fatigued'

  AVG(Sleep_Disruption_percentage * 100) AS Sleep_disruption_percentage
  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
  WHERE
  Fatigueness_during_the_day = 'Not at all Fatigued'

  /*On average, the sleep disruption was about 8,12% when the fatigueness was recorded as "Completely Fatigued" 
  vs 1% when the fatigueness was recorded as "Not at all Fatigued"*/
  
--It looks like sleep disruption has a big impact on the fatigue in the next day.

   --4. What is the main sleep disruption factor that has been recorded in this period of time? 

 SELECT 
 SUM (Disrupted_by_noise) AS disrupted_by_noise,
 SUM(Disrupted_by_caregiving) AS disrupted_by_caregiving,
 SUM(nightmare) AS nightmare,
 SUM(stress_anxiety) AS stress_anxiety,
 SUM(alcohol_prior_bedtime) AS alcohol_before_bedtime
 FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
 
 
 --Disrupted by noise has had the most occurrencies (45 in total), followed by disrupted by caregiving (37 occurrencies)

  /*5. What is the main factor (in percentage) that made me lose sleep and impacted the restdness when waking up the most 
  (or the fatigueness during the day)?*/
  
  SELECT 
      ROUND (SUM (Disrupted_by_noise/97 *100), 2) AS disrupted_by_noise_percent,
      ROUND (SUM (Disrupted_by_caregiving/97 *100), 2) AS disrupted_by_caregiving_percent,
      ROUND (SUM(Nightmare/ 97 *100), 2) AS Nightmare_percent,
      ROUND (SUM(Stress_Anxiety / 97 *100), 2) AS Stress_anxiety_percent,
      ROUND (SUM(Alcohol_prior_bedtime/97 *100), 2) AS alcohol_prior_bedtime_percent
	  FROM [Sleep_Study].[dbo].[sleep]
	WHERE Difficult_Staying_asleep = '1' AND
 Restdness_when_waking_up = 'Not at all Rested' OR
 Fatigueness_during_the_day = 'Completely Fatigued'


 /*Disrupted by noise was the main factor associated with the difficulty staying asleep and restdness when waking up (16.49%),
 followed by Disrupted by Caregiving (14.43%)*/
