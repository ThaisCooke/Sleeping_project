# Sleeping_project
Report of sleeping patterns.

The App "Sleep Watch" was used to collect data of my sleeping patterns. This data was collected for three months. The table was created on Microsoft SQL server and this data will be imported to Excel and Tableau for Visualizations. 

This project is to check the correlation between a good night sleep and restfulness, and the factors that contribute to a restful night.

The thought process is documented here, the coding can be found above


## Questions to be answered

1. What is the average sleep (in hours) that I had during this period of time?
2. How does the average sleep (in hours) compares to the fatigue during the day?
3. How does sleep disruption percentage relates to fatigueness during the day?
4. What is the main sleep disruption factor that has been recorded in this period of time? 
5. What is the main factor (in percentage) that made me lose sleep and impacted the restdness when waking up the most 
  (or the fatigueness during the day)?
6. Create a SP to play with parameters and answer: How does three day sleep target relates to fatigueness during the day?
7. Does working out helps for better night sleep?
