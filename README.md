# Sleeping_project
Report of sleeping patterns.

The App "Sleep Watch" was used to collect data of my sleeping patterns. This data was collected for three months. The table was created on Microsoft SQL server and this data will be imported to Excel and Tableau for Visualizations. 

This project is to check the correlation between a good night sleep and restfulness, and the factors that contribute to a restful night.
